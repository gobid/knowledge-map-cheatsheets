# Knowledge Map Cheat Sheets, by Learning Dollars Talent

Goal: 
To assemble all established knowledge into an efficient set of cheat sheets for interdisciplinary innovation.

What percent of all established knowledge do you know? Find out by joining http://www.learningdollarstalent.com and marking your skills. You will be able to mark the technical skills and academic topics you know. 

This has been incredibly humbling for all of us. Many of us, myself included, came out of high school thinking we know it all. And out of college realizing we know nothing. At a rate of 4 life long courses per year, it will take 20 lifetimes of studying to learn and apply everything. Hence you have to pick and choose what courses you want to take in order to make your contribution to society. 

My belief is that you can learn things for 2 reasons: 
- to appreciate and experience the universe
- to make a contribution to society 

I recommend choosing what you learn to optimize both:
- first, graduate from high school, undergrad, or grad school (18-35) 
- next, create a selection of 40 lifelong learning courses that you can complete over 10 years (35-45)
- try to include a little bit of representation from every field and a lot of depth in one field (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) 
- you can browse other profiles on http://www.learningdollarstalent.com to find out how unique you T-shaped skillset is
- finally spend the rest of your career applying what you have learned to your life contribution whether it's research, a company, art, or a political contribution.

LD Talent can also help you find opportunities (given your skillset / what you know) or talent for hire (given your needs / what you don't know).

Mission: 
Let's not get bogged down by information overload! Let's cut to the chase (in TOPOLOGICAL order so we never get stuck).

Method: To be used in conjunction with: 
- moocs from http://class-central.com, http://coursera.org, http://edx.org, http://codecademy.com
- lectures on http://youtube.com, http://khanacademy.org, http://ck12.org, http://bighistoryproject.com
- articles from http://google.com or http://scholar.google.com
- answers on http://stackexchange.com, http://investopedia.com, http://quora.com, http://medium.com 
- exercises found by searching "[subject name] problems / exercises" on google
- educational software found by searching "[subject name] software" or "[subject name] educational software" on google
- educational games found by searching "[subject name] games" or "[subject name] educational games" on google
- educational apps found by searching "[subject name] app" on google play or app store
- books on https://www.gutenberg.org/, https://projecteuclid.org/, https://openlibrary.org/, https://manybooks.net/, https://www.audible.com/, http://www.openculture.com/freeaudiobooks or just by google searching "nearest library" and finding books or audiobooks from there

with the objective of structuring learning around a standard syllabus.

While learning to use a mobile device, computer, tablet and mouse has been intuitive since the the advent of the graphical user interface, typing may be something people still have to 'learn with effort'. If needed you can learn typing for free online using https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+typing+online+free.

This project IS NOT solving the problem of learning content -- online courses, videos, and q&a sites listed above solve that problem. 

This project IS solving the problem of "going down a rabbit hole of prerequisites". When you don't know concept A, then you look it up, but find out you need to know unknown concept B which leads you to unknown concept C and so on. This project should eliminate that problem by presenting all established knowledge in topological order of prerequisites. 

This project SHOULD ALSO help with writing proofs or arguments by surfacing all reference theorems / concepts in one place. 

Finally, this project should stop you from feeling guilty about forgetting what you learned a few years ago by reminding you with ample context.

Explore these subjects to grasp the fundamentals of all knowledge:

1. Mathematics
2. Statistics
3. Computer Science
4. Physics - EE, MechE, Product Design, CivilE, Architecture, EnvE, AeroE, and Astronomy
5. Chemistry - ChemE
6. Biology - Medicine, BioE
7. Psychology - Cognitive Science
8. Economics - Business and Finance
9. Humanities - Literature (grammar, vocab), Journalism, History, Geography, Philosophy, Political Science, and Law
10. Art - Visual Arts, Dance, Music (music theory, piano, singing, etc; spotify / saavn, youtube), Culinary Arts

FLIPPED CLASS IS MUCH BETTER. Can pause and understand comfortably. Live chat or Piazza helps.
