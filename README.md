# Knowledge Map Cheat Sheets, by Learning Dollars Talent

### Goal
To assemble all established knowledge into an efficient set of cheat sheets for interdisciplinary innovation. 

This compilation is intended to serve the learners of the world who don't have access to developed world institutions like Stanford and Northwestern. No matter where you are or what you have, if you're reading this on a computer or phone, you can learn this material and find a way toward disciplinary expertise. Online courses and resources may have all the information you need, but this repository gives you a structured curriculum with which to guide your studies and professional development. 

What we mean by "established knowledge" is conceptual textbook and course knowledge. Not research knowledge, research courses, derivative knowledge, or skill / tool specific knowledge (for which plentiful documentation exists on the web). 
- One good heuristic is that these are the common set of topics that every reputable research university in the world (such as "R1 universities" in the US) offers their undergrad and graduate students. 
- Another heuristic is that after mastering this knowledge (or disciplinary slices of it), you should be an expert, ready to apply knowledge and push it forward. So, this is the real deal, not some popular science content for a lay audience. 
- A final heuristic - this is the core knowledge of all society. Sure there are an infinite amount of mixed and matched skills, hierarchies, variants, minutiae, derivative knowledge, literatures, vocations, professions, formalisms, rules, findings, papers, projects, classifications, applications etc. But, this is the core conceptual knowledge that marks expertise in any given discipline. 
- Obviously, this is a continuously evolving repository and you can submit a pull request if you think some knowledge should be added or edited.

### What do you know? 
What percent of all established knowledge do you know? Find out by joining http://www.learningdollarstalent.com and marking your skills. You will be able to mark the technical skills and academic topics you know. 

This has been incredibly humbling for all of us. Many of us, myself included, came out of high school thinking we know it all. And out of college realizing we know nothing. At a rate of 4 life long courses per year, it will take perhaps 5 lifetimes of studying to learn and apply everything. Hence you have to pick and choose what courses you want to take in order to make your contribution to society. We hope you choose a nice "slice".

My belief is that people learn things for 4 reasons: 
- because they have to (i.e. many school children)
- for money (i.e. some college students and professional development scholars)
- to appreciate and experience the universe (i.e. book worms and hobbyists)
- to make a contribution to society (i.e. professors, entrepreneurs, leaders, and artists)

I recommend choosing what you learn to optimize the latter 2 reasons to learn:
- First, graduate from high school, undergrad, or grad school (18-35).
- Next, create a selection of 40 lifelong learning courses that you can complete over 10 years (35-45).
- Try to include a little bit of representation from every field and a lot of depth in one field (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).
- You can browse other profiles on http://www.learningdollarstalent.com to find out how unique your T-shaped skillset is.
- Finally spend the rest of your career applying your knowledge to your life contribution, doing an auxiliary life long learning course here or there, as needed for your contribution. At this stage, making the contribution is probably more of a priority than learning, since you're likely more than half way through your life. What a shame it would be to learn Calculus and then die before ever applying it! We live in a strange society where every 80 years we flush down everything a person has learned, and the next generation has to re-learn it. 
- Your contribution may be research, a company, art, or a political contribution.

LD Talent can also help you find: 
- opportunities (given your skillset / what you know) 
- talent for hire (given your needs / what you don't know)

### Mission: 
Let's not get bogged down by information overload! Let's cut to the chase (in TOPOLOGICAL order so we never get stuck).

Method: To be used in conjunction with: 
- moocs from http://class-central.com, http://coursera.org, http://edx.org, http://codecademy.com
- lectures on http://youtube.com, http://khanacademy.org, http://ck12.org, https://www.ixl.com/, http://bighistoryproject.com
- resources on open courseware sites like https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm, https://www.oeconsortium.org/, https://oyc.yale.edu/, https://open.umich.edu/, https://ocw.jhsph.edu/, 
- articles from http://google.com, http://scholar.google.com, https://www.researchgate.net/, http://academia.edu/
    - if you find you don't have access to articles found on google scholar, you may try using the internet at your local library or university to download the articles (they might have a subscription to the likes of sciencedirect or jstor)
- textbooks found online through google, https://libgen.is/ and https://epdf.pub/ - this is a controversial method that we don't endorse or comment on, all we can say is that we believe that textbooks are overpriced and hence disenfranchise the majority world and the poor of the world from information access - those who can afford access to such textbook information are often those people whose ancestors benefited from the theivery of colonialism
- research articles found by googling labs at accreddited universities (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/) and looking at their papers on their websites
- a note: if you don't have access to a lab, we suggest watching youtube videos of relevant scientific experiments you're curious about
- answers on http://stackexchange.com, http://investopedia.com, http://quora.com, http://medium.com 
- searching https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+its+made for literally any thing
- exercises found by searching "[subject name] problems / exercises" on google
- educational software found by searching "[subject name] software" or "[subject name] educational software" on google
- educational games found by searching "[subject name] games" or "[subject name] educational games" on google
- educational apps found by searching "[subject name] app" on google play or app store
- books on https://www.gutenberg.org/, https://projecteuclid.org/, https://openlibrary.org/, https://manybooks.net/, https://www.audible.com/, http://www.openculture.com/freeaudiobooks or just by google searching "nearest library" and finding books or audiobooks from there

with the objective of structuring learning around a standard syllabus.

While learning to use a mobile device, computer, tablet and mouse has been intuitive since the the advent of the graphical user interface, typing may be something people still have to 'learn with effort'. If needed you can learn typing for free online using https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+typing+online+free.

This project IS NOT solving the problem of learning content -- online courses, videos, and q&a sites listed above solve that problem. 

This project IS solving the problem of "going down a rabbit hole of prerequisites". When you don't know concept A, then you look it up, but find out you need to know unknown concept B which leads you to unknown concept C and so on. This project should eliminate that problem by presenting all established knowledge in topological order of prerequisites. 

This project SHOULD ALSO help with writing proofs or arguments by surfacing all reference theorems / concepts in one place. 

Finally, this project should stop you from feeling guilty about forgetting what you learned a few years ago by reminding you with ample context.

### What about skills and tools? 

Now this covers knowledge (i.e. Machine Learning, Algorithms, Statistical Mechanics, Genetics) but what about skills and tools (i.e. Tensorflow, Java, Matlab, Biopython)?

Well, to see all the interesting and in-demand skills and tools you can learn, we recommend visiting: 
https://www.learningdollars.com/client/select_engineers/ 

To learn them simply google "[skill name] tutorial", "learn [skill name]", "[skill name] free online course", "[skill name] documentation", or "tools for [skill name / subject name]". 

You'll get a ton of text and video material to learn from. We recommend going for the official documentation whenever possible. Then mark that you know that skill on your LD profile. You can make one by pressing "be an engineer" on https://www.learningdollarstalent.com/.

### Why is this all in English only?

As per this comment about the balance of powers of society's languages (https://bit.ly/2JivbUn) and this comment about society's inventions and discoveries (https://bit.ly/33N1OTs) on our first cultural blog post, we at LD Talent use and accept English as the lingua franca of the world. 

All peoples of the world own and shape English now. This harkens the famous "Empire strikes back" jokes (Trevor Noah, Anuvab Pal, Russel Peters, etc). Jokes aside, nowadays far more non-English writers contribute to English writing and communication than ones hailing from England do. Just like everyone uses the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, everyone uses English writing and speaking. It's ok. English is a human possession now. Moreover, the English language is related to Indo-European languages as East as Sanskrit and Bengali and has gained words from non Indo-European language groups as well. Like: 

- algebra from Arabic
- maize from Native American Taino
- mongoose from South Indian Telugu and West Indian Marathi
- chai from Mandarin
- tattoo from Tahitian
- banana from West African Mande

- https://www.theguardian.com/education/gallery/2015/jan/23/a-language-family-tree-in-pictures
- https://www.google.com/search?q=language+tree

So with that said we only focus on English and present all our materials in English (just like StackOverflow and StackExchange do for instance). If you are not fluent in English, here are the learning resources we recommend: 
- https://www.duolingo.com/ (you can actually learn most major world languages with this)
- https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/sat/
- http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-games/vocabulary-quiz
- https://www.class-central.com/search?lang=english&q=english
- https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+typing+online+free (for typing)
- https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/
- https://www.britishcouncil.si/en/english/apps

### We also created a spreadsheet of 8000+ English words and phrases translated into 11 regional South Asian languages and they are all here:

Words and Phrases: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L7ZG-bMcku1g5nDpo9E46dBQXFU2HXKrRPENva2qZ80/edit#gid=759234093

Recordings of Words and Phrases: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B8C-fNTa0hp9NmdxNkROMUVQZU0

The sheet and recordings take a while to load but it's worth it.

The languages include:

- Hindi
- Gujarati
- Marathi
- Arabic
- Urdu
- Telugu
- Tamil
- Punjabi (in Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi)
- Bengali
- Malayalam
- Kannada

Duolingo does a good job at covering most of the rest of the world's major languages <=> English.
