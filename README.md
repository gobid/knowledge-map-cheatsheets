# Knowledge Map Cheat Sheets

Goal: 
To assemble all established knowledge into an efficient set of cheat sheets for interdisciplinary innovation.

Mission: 
Let's not get bogged down by information overload! Let's cut to the chase (in TOPOLOGICAL order so we never get stuck).

To contribute: 
1. fork the project
2. edit the fork (Please cite the source somehow, either an indication of the author on the pdf or below in the citations.)
3. push to your fork (adding github as a remote for your fork might help https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11690709/can-a-project-have-multiple-origins) and
4. make a pull request from your fork to this project 

Method: To be used in conjunction with moocs from class-central.com / coursera / edx / codecademy, lectures on youtube.com / khanacademy.org, articles from google.com or scholar.google.com, answers on stackexchange.com with the objective of structuring learning around a standard syllabus.

Explore these subjects to grasp the fundamentals of all knowledge:
1. Mathematics
2. Statistics
3. Computer Science
4. Physics (including EE/MechE/Civil&EnvE/AeroE)
5. Astronomy
6. Chemistry (including ChemE)
7. Biology (including BioE)
8. Medicine
9. Economics
10. Psychology
11. History
12. Music (piano, music theory, singing, etc; use spotify, youtube, & saavn radio to discover)

FLIPPED CLASS IS MUCH BETTER. Can pause and understand comfortably. Live chat or Piazza helps.
