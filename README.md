# Knowledge Map Cheat Sheets, by Learning Dollars Talent

Goal: 
To assemble all established knowledge into an efficient set of cheat sheets for interdisciplinary innovation.

What percent of all established knowledge do you know? Find out by joining Learning Dollars Talent. You will be able to mark the technical skills and academic topics you know.

The sheet can also help you find collaborators for industry, startup, or research projects.

Mission: 
Let's not get bogged down by information overload! Let's cut to the chase (in TOPOLOGICAL order so we never get stuck).

Method: To be used in conjunction with: 
- moocs from http://class-central.com, http://coursera.org, http://edx.org, http://codecademy.com
- lectures on http://youtube.com, http://khanacademy.org, http://ck12.org, http://bighistoryproject.com
- articles from http://google.com or http://scholar.google.com
- answers on http://stackexchange.com, http://investopedia.com, http://quora.com, http://medium.com 
- exercises found by searching "[subject name] problems / exercises" on google
- educational games found by searching "[subject name] games" or "[subject name] educational games" on google

with the objective of structuring learning around a standard syllabus.

This project IS NOT solving the problem of learning content -- online courses, videos, and q&a sites listed above solve that problem. 

This project IS solving the problem of "going down a rabbit hole of prerequisites". When you don't know concept A, then you look it up, but find out you need to know unknown concept B which leads you to unknown concept C and so on. This project should eliminate that problem by presenting all established knowledge in topological order of prerequisites. 

This project SHOULD ALSO help with writing proofs or arguments by surfacing all reference theorems / concepts in one place. 

Finally, this project should stop you from feeling guilty about forgetting what you learned a few years ago by reminding you with ample context.

Explore these subjects to grasp the fundamentals of all knowledge:

1. Mathematics
2. Statistics
3. Computer Science
4. Physics - EE, MechE, Product Design, CivilE, Architecture, EnvE, AeroE, and Astronomy
5. Chemistry - ChemE
6. Biology - Medicine, BioE
7. Psychology - Cognitive Science
8. Economics - Business and Finance
9. Humanities - Literature (grammar, vocab), Journalism, History, Geography, Philosophy, Political Science, and Law
10. Art - Visual Arts, Dance, Music (music theory, piano, singing, etc; spotify / saavn, youtube), Culinary Arts

FLIPPED CLASS IS MUCH BETTER. Can pause and understand comfortably. Live chat or Piazza helps.
