learning from materials (Gears, Logo, Legos, Erector)
concrete thinking
formal thinking - i.e. combinatorial thinking, where one has to reason in terms of the set of all possible states of a system, and self-referential thinking about thinking itself
epistemologist - person who studies knowledge, how it came about, and its justification
children as epistemologists
conservationist view of the world
dissociated learning
Pigetian learning
Mathetic - knowledge about learning, mathetics to learning as heuristics to problem solving
Appropriable - personalizable learning
continuity principle - mathematics to personal life
power principle - empower learner to accomplish things
priniciple of cultural resonance - be accepted by the community
synotic learning - turtle is body synotic with child
Polya's General Methods for Problem Solving (Process)
Formalism of Calculus - Turtle's Circle program - Differential Equation
Relational / Affective
Cultural Syntonicity - navigating the world like the turtle
Verbalizable versus non-Verbalizable knowledge
structured programming
resistance (to debugging, subfeaturizing)
Velocity and Acceleration Turtles for Newton's 3rd Law (monkey and rope problem)
Bourbaki Mother Structures - mapping between mathematics concepts in geo, algebra with affordances of the mind
Graduated Length Method - in skiing

appropriability
evocativeness
integration - affords representing multiple concepts
situational learning
appprentice learning
ISDP - instructional software design project
personalization (remembering students actually acting out fd 100 in elementary school)
linear vs modular programming
disconnection of knowledge (knowledge starts off as knowledge in parts)
time frame and rhythms of work (not all non-concentrated work time is bad, chatting and relaxing is important for creative work)
metacognitive awareness
cognitive flexibility
control distractions and anxiety
continual evaluation
monitor solution processes, articulation
relationship with concepts (willingness to take risks, etc)
generating one's own explanations for a concept
dynamic communication - defining and redefining - intereaction between software producer and medium
representations vs algorithms
social goals and purpose driven exercise
structural definition of microworld
functional definition of microworld
internal vs external notations
learning dynamic - comparing expectations with findings
naturally self-correcting microworld
Microworlds for physics / dynamics, thermodynamics / gas particles (Uri's), Euclidean Space (Blocks), motion / velocity, economics (Smithstown)
intrinsic environment - students given working model, mathematics learned intrinsic to the model, feedback is direct, rich env for exploration and the more math they apply the more they can do
microworld - computational objects, mutliple representations, combinations for complex objects, set of activities => learners manipulate objects, interpret feedback, solve challenges
experimental-feedback cycle - where learning happens from functional perspective
objectivism
ideal symbol systems (follow an objectivist approach)
transparency of system - carried through examples and experience in the case of computer models (social contexts, transfer to situations)
