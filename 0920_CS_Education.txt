intrinsic environment - students given working model, mathematics learned intrinsic to the model, feedback is direct, rich env for exploration and the more math they apply the more they can do
microworld - computational objects, mutliple representations, combinations for complex objects, set of activities => learners manipulate objects, interpret feedback, solve challenges
experimental-feedback cycle - where learning happens from functional perspective
objectivism
ideal symbol systems (follow an objectivist approach)
transparency of system - carried through examples and experience in the case of computer models (social contexts, transfer to situations)

programming knowledge structures
- microstructure level understanding - line by line level
[TS] - macrostructure level understanding - program flow level
[TS] procedural level understanding - control flow (mattered more for 80 studied programmers in Pennington work)
functional level understanding - goal hierarchy
1. goal hierarchy abstraction - higher level goals and more specific goals of a program (think functions) - tasks goals may be important for mental representations (later when doing comprehension after having understood functions)
2. data flow abstraction
3. control flow abstraction - sequence of program actions
4. conditionalized action - a set of conditions results in some action which results in a set of new conditions
text structure knowledge - break down into nodes of sequence of actions, iteration, conditionals make up programs (like prime number factorization)
- whether code is meaningful or not, structure helps a learner comprehend it
- data flow may be difficult to infer since that flows between units
plan knowledge - how patterns of program instructions "go together" (e.g. summing, hashing, counting, etc)
- hypothesize plans, subplans, etc of a program, then validate them
- based on data flow relations
- here data flow info more accessible, exact functional implementation less accessible
text structure units (TS) vs planned knowledge units (PK) - TS had faster response time (response when recognizing program statements and what they do)
=> PK - data flow and functional relations important - content-dependent knowledge that links specific program functions to plans that achieve them
=> TS - control flow and procedural relations - abstract knowledge of program text structures
TS IMPORTANT INITIALLY ESTABLISHING PROGRAM STRUCTURE IN MEMORY, MACROSTRUCTURES ARE PROCEDURES / CONTROL FLOW
PK IMPORTANT LATER - FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE AND SITUATION IN WHICH PROGRAM IS APPLIED (situational model) - this is distinct from macrostructure organization of codebase provided by TS

constructionism allows any learner to learn how they want, demand-pull of the concepts (ie math concepts) they need
learning-by-making idea and style idea (painter programmer vs formal planner programmer)



To Do: 
- scan rale-proj papers for CS Education terms
- scan explicit-metacog and role-of-self-reg papers for terms
- scan terms for which need defs or not (perhaps add bolds around terms but not defs, use sublime to do this)

Based on CS Education related courses (LRN_SCI 301, 426) from:
