naturally self-correcting microworld
Microworlds for physics / dynamics, thermodynamics / gas particles (Uri's), Euclidean Space (Blocks), motion / velocity, economics (Smithstown)
intrinsic environment - students given working model, mathematics learned intrinsic to the model, feedback is direct, rich env for exploration and the more math they apply the more they can do
microworld - computational objects, mutliple representations, combinations for complex objects, set of activities => learners manipulate objects, interpret feedback, solve challenges
experimental-feedback cycle - where learning happens from functional perspective
objectivism
ideal symbol systems (follow an objectivist approach)
transparency of system - carried through examples and experience in the case of computer models (social contexts, transfer to situations)

programming knowledge structures
- microstructure level understanding - line by line level
[TS] - macrostructure level understanding - program flow level
[TS] procedural level understanding - control flow (mattered more for 80 studied programmers in Pennington work)
functional level understanding - goal hierarchy
1. goal hierarchy abstraction - higher level goals and more specific goals of a program (think functions) - tasks goals may be important for mental representations (later when doing comprehension after having understood functions)
2. data flow abstraction
3. control flow abstraction - sequence of program actions
4. conditionalized action - a set of conditions results in some action which results in a set of new conditions
text structure knowledge - break down into nodes of sequence of actions, iteration, conditionals make up programs (like prime number factorization)
- whether code is meaningful or not, structure helps a learner comprehend it
- data flow may be difficult to infer since that flows between units
plan knowledge - how patterns of program instructions "go together" (e.g. summing, hashing, counting, etc)
- hypothesize plans, subplans, etc of a program, then validate them
- based on data flow relations
- here data flow info more accessible, exact functional implementation less accessible
text structure units (TS) vs planned knowledge units (PK) - TS had faster response time (response when recognizing program statements and what they do)
=> PK - data flow and functional relations important - content-dependent knowledge that links specific program functions to plans that achieve them
=> TS - control flow and procedural relations - abstract knowledge of program text structures
TS IMPORTANT INITIALLY ESTABLISHING PROGRAM STRUCTURE IN MEMORY, MACROSTRUCTURES ARE PROCEDURES / CONTROL FLOW
PK IMPORTANT LATER - FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE AND SITUATION IN WHICH PROGRAM IS APPLIED (situational model) - this is distinct from macrostructure organization of codebase provided by TS

constructionism allows any learner to learn how they want, demand-pull of the concepts (ie math concepts) they need
learning-by-making idea and style idea (painter programmer vs formal planner programmer)
Logo works for fractions - hard quantitative evidence - even though they don't like fractions when taught in its traditional manner
epistemology - nature of knowledge vs nature of knowing
conservation - of quantity, is the basis of numbers and math, first understanding more / less based on shapes, then truly based on quantity, noting that quantity of liquid doesn't change as it goes into different shapes
confusion of quantity with a quality of say one-dimension (like the height of a liquid in a particular beaker) - qualitative seriation
- child in first stage has a wrong understanding, child in second stage has 2 conflicting understandings to reconcile, by third stage children know liquid is conserved, multiplication of LxW is what leads to the recognition of conservation for some, in the second stage the child realizes that the other half is the difference of the whole minus the first half
    - noting that the liquid in B1 + B2 is all coming from A1 
    - noting more dimensions like width and depth 
    - recognizing the multiplicity of the number of glasses 
    - students realizing that half + half = whole. 
    - I also am curious whether the order of these realizations comes to different students differently.

levels - of understanding, combining lower ones to form higher ones (jams vs cars, levels of computing from electrons to code)
slippage - confusion between levels of understanding can lead to misunderstanding
StarLogo - helps people build models of multilevel understanding
combo is different from sum of parts - waves - traffic jam wave, wave on a rope
systemic approach - studying systems as opposed to phenomena in isolation
organizational chart view - traditional hierarchical way of thinking about levels

emergent behavior - human wave arises, moves across crowd as individual humans move arms up/down
StarLogo - many turtles to simulate complex systems (from scratch, or modify complex system)
pacemaker cell - leader cells that help other cells aggregate in slime, pacemakers are not needed for aggregation
centralized vs decentralized control
positive and negative feedback for cluster growth, larger clusters are more stable
randomness - important for changing clusters (students start off with more deterministic mindsets)
macro-level rules vs micro-level rules (only need to program micro-level rules)
StarLogo vs DiffEq - starlogo allows students to zoom into individual view not just solving a diffeq
- mutli turtle, connection machines, made at thinking machines, redesigned starlogo to netlogo - still an active team
Minsky - taller vs more - taller does it always win - administrative layer to mind - appearance taller vs wider - but history tells us  tells us the liquid is confined -- so it stays the same

Programmable Brick - type commands into brick, includes even the Lego Logo Brick (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Logo, Lego Mindstorms)
BBB - beyone black boxes - students design scientific instruments
    - engineering aspects of scientific inquiry
    - new application can lead to new tech but vice versa also
perspective - children should understand technologies rather than become enslaved to them (cricket thermometer they build it themselves so they understand temperature conversions better)

Bifocal modeling - computers, robotics, real-world sensing

Agent-based modeling - agent follows certain rules, epiphenomena emerge
- physical + virtual students performed better than only virtual
Bifocal modeling - connecting virtual and physical models to improve understanding
- ability to compare theoretical and practical models
- ability to use physical data as training data in ml algorithms
Scale - 100 agent simulations can mimic billion molecule real world interactions

Energy loss - newtonian physics taught in schools is a rough approximation of the true situation (air resistance, friction, other variations etc)
Sychronicity - synchronize physical sensor readings with software model ticks

Embodied Modeling Approach for Biology
Agent-based modeling of molecules, cells, organisms etc and then using micro rules in software to observe emergent macro phenomena
NetLogo agent-based modeling to explore “levels” in biology, agent-level to complex system level
- elicits scientific inquiry from the students
- mechanism should be included in rules when possible, otherwise use probabilities
- danger of curve fitting to get the right emergent model can be overcome by a strategy of questioning missing components
- removes requirement of complex mathematics (i.e. diffeq)
Classical tools vs embodied tools — former make aggregate level assumptions, latter code individual assumptions and discover aggregate-level consequences
- scrutinize both individual assumptions and aggregate outcomes in embodied tools
- scrutinize only aggregate outcomes in classical tools
- equations seem to fit data but don’t provide explanations of mechanism that embodied models do
(- seems levels should apply to JS program comprehension too)
- equally plausible models must be compared using 
- students will be more prepared for scientific inquiry, (but they need to compare with exp data?)
Agent-personification - i.e. Paul pretending to be the firefly in order to understand how it would move in conjunction with other matter
Robustness - a model that isn’t perturbed by parameter changes, particularly small ones

participatory system - where all actors both machines and humans may take active or passive roles
conversational system - - systems that take human conversation as a metaphor (though not implying the necessary use of human language)

story telling in computing medium - plot, tension, catharsis, etc in interactions with the computer
convivial - media in which all partipants can contribute content

Protean teaching tools - ones that are very versatile to custom learner interests, such as computers
transitional object - one that enables a bridge between “concrete” (example-based) and “formal” (abstract) stages of reasoning (i.e. logo turtle, mindstorms robot)
physical settings - ones that exploit the affordances of physical objects for pedagogical purposes, physical objects have certain affordances particularly for children (think physicalized microworlds)

primitives in constructionism - base tools to work with, "forward" "backward" the turtle (differential) in Logo better than compass and straight edge (what greek's had in their mathematics)
big vs wig - beyond the information given (let them discover it themselves), with information given (tell them then constructivist activity)

material intelligence - computer literacy in our computerized society
pillars of literacy - material dependencies (physical objects like pen and paper, computers); cognitive dependencies (human has to be able to interpret the book); social basis in community for advanced literacies
social niche - interests and activities of individual people in society that fill a "niche" in the complex web of society - affected by material dependencies - computers need to support all niches
protean material dependencies - material dependencies (i.e. computational media) that can support all the niches (from romance novels to scientific journal articles)

scaffold

Knowledge Representations
- LS stimulus response bond - learners react to stimuli
- ACT theory - the bridge between learning and performance
- production rule - 
- thorndikes cats - they got out of a box due to trial and error, stimulus and response - not problem solving
- Behaviorism, also known as behavioral psychology, is a theory of learning based on the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning (wikipedia)
- Gestalt psychologists - is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies (from wikipedia) - used problem solving to prove points and prove wrong behaviorists but did not look into problem solving process
- Newell and Simon - looked at problem solving, and the general relationship between problem solving and learning
- Tolman - importance of goals for learning and behavior
- problem solving - state, operator - transforms one state to another / rules, search through states by applying operators 
- internal vs external application of operators - the problem solver imagines some sequence of actions vs the problem solver directly applies some actions
- problem-solving method - principles used for selecting operators
- hill climbing - find similar states to goal state
- problem solving and learning - goals convert what has been learned into performance (via problem solving)
- LISP

- interpretation - "the system can interpret an ex-pression if the expression designates a process and if, given the expression, the system can carry out the process"
- turing machine - symbol system (manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules)
- necessary - exhibits general intelligence
- sufficient - any physical symbol system of sufficient size can be organized further to exhibit general intelligence.
- hypothesis - physical symbol systems are capable of intelligent action, and that general intelligent action calls for a physical symbol system
- formal logic - mathematical logic, propositional, first order, etc. 
- milestones in computing after turing machines: stored programs (Eniac), list processing, LISP, 
- GPS - general problem solver, PLANNER, CONNIVER - first AI systems 
- modeling human behavior as symbol systems - information processing psychology - process of experimentally finding out whether symbol systems and human cognition converge
- heuristic search - using heuristic rules to guide search so you don't have to traverse the exponential search space - selectivity on branches to explore 
- solution generation in problem space - harder than just a verification problem
- weak methods - methods that deal with the control of exponential expansion
- strong methods - highly structured situations (linear programming problems)
- optimizing search with global variables
- semantic recognition systems - cached information that may be helpful for problem solving
- representations - mutilated checker board - you know that there are 2 less squares of one color than the other - and each tile must cover 1 black / 1 white - this latter representation makes it easier to solve the problem

- schema - building blocks of cognition
- schema theory - all knowledge is packaged into units, data structure for representing generic concepts (they use sensory data)
    - like a play that has instantiations, *variables* can take on values, but schemas are more abstract / abstractable and are about any concept not just a set of events), consists of *sub-schemas*
    - like theories in that they can predict events or outcomes
    - like procedures because they evaluate the quality of their own fit to available data (are *active*), and have sub-procedures/schema
    - like parser - *recognition devices* which given a sequence of symbols determines whether the sequence forms a legal sentence, etc (computational linguistics)
    - *can represent knowledge at all levels of abstraction*
    - *can represent knowledge rather than definitions*
- conceptual-driven processing - expectation-driven - when a schema is activated and it activates subschemata which are expected to account for some portion of the input data
- data-driven activation - activated from the bottom-up whenever subschema that has been somehow activated causes the various schemata of which it is a part to be activated (car salesman story - activation of lower schemas lets us bottom-up deduce higher level schema of car-selling story, sometimes can follow by top-down knowledge of the higher level schema to flow down)
- recognizability - to be recognized a schema has to have an internal structure (carrot nose out of context vs detailed nose)
    - schemata for words not random letters
- premature commitment to wrong schema - can be debilitating making people stick to wrong schema longer than they would have otherwise
- 3 reasons for failure - not having the right schemata, not having the right sensory clues to bottom up infer the schemata, not understanding the text correctly to find the right schemata
- schema and memory - schema can help structure concepts in the users mind and this may be the fundamental requirement for remembering (but the danger is it can also lead to restructuring to fit schema)
- perception - goal directed, it's not just about taking existing info and fitting it into schema, but rather seeking useful information
- accretion - fact learning - imbibing text or knowledge over time and being able to remember and access it (no new schema formed)
- tuning - refinement of knowledge through experiment and experience (evolution of existing schema, i.e. making more generalizable)
- restructuring - new schema through combining old schema or inferring from experential data 
    - pattern generation - copying old schema with modifications, learning by analogy
    - induction - learning from data, if events / configurations occur multiple times in nature then we can form a schema out of them
- familiarity of problem can help users surface schema that they may otherwise not be able to draw upon (vowel/number card problem vs sears receipt problem)   

- knowledge about story structure
    - story schema - frame and slot to represent what the user knows about the story structure
    - story grammar - hierarchy of categories of story information
- story content - events and causal relations because of specific story content
- world knowledge - knowledge of human goals tendencies traits context
- integrating different types of texts - narratives, expositions, descriptions
- reader model's text level processing - how readers uses schema to comprehend and recall a passage
- factors affecting text integration
    - Knowledge of the structure of the text genre.
    - Knowledge about the referential situation.
    - Integrative cues in the text.
    - Constructing generalizations or abstractions.
    - Focusing on the causal or temporal chain of events in a narrative text.
    - Focusing on the described phenomena and their explanation in an expository text.
    - Focusing on the referential situation in a descriptive text.
- story schema - knowledge that members of a culture extract about the typical structure of stories
- bartlett's experiment - people fit stories into schema that they know (and an attitude they assume)
    - images (instantiations of schema parts) help highlight schema items
- story grammar - a slightly different characterization of the knowledge of story structures - directly denotes hierarchical relationships within the story
    - setting (where&when) and episode (what happens) - setting, event, internal response, action, event
    - hierarchical tree structure
- reading time on sentences higher in the hierarchy is greater
    - more interesting, or may take more time to integrate into understanding of story
    - also spend more time on sentences at the boundary of an episode
    - they remember these sentences better as well
- causal relations - how earlier episodes affect later ones
    - actions can be caused by goals, vocations, traits, acts of god
    - time to read a sentence goes up as the causal distance increases between it and the sentence that precedes it
- goal pursual - narratives consist of a protagonist pursuing a goal
- plot unit - a particular configuration of goals, actions, and affective states
- assessments of story structure - can scramble sentences, can have same content serve different structural roles (setting, initiating event, internal response, consequence, reaction)
- causal centrality and story grammar categories
    - central event or state must describe a superordinate rather than a component entity (eating breakfast not pouring cereal)
    - central event or state - may be part of the causal chain of events and states that lead from beginning to end of story
    - central event or state may introduce a main character
- script - a schema for knowledge about routine occurrences
    - as opposed to a schema for story structure (containing slots like story structure and resolution)
    - balancing story structure and story content pedagogy is important
- knowledge of people - general knowledge of how humans behave, their motivations, concerns, etc
- knowledge of specific content domains - slots can have default values that can be inferred if they were not mentioned (you pay the bill at the restaurant) where the schema is the frame-with-slots structure
    - how choice is determined of which schema to use is not completely understood
- narrative - describes events linked by causation or theme
    - reader fills in gaps of causal chain
- descriptions - refers to a static situation in terms of its physical features
    - reader sequentially adds to their understanding when reading
    - context and background knowledge important for understanding descriptions sometimes
- exposition - describes logically related events to inform or persuade (job-related reading, news media)
    - read the information about more important schema slots at a slower rate than information about less important schema slots
- theme extraction - can be from topic sentence, sometimes reader needs to figure it out from prose
    - if later sentences contradict topic, then generalization is redone
- integrative cues in texts - explicit cues how different clauses relate to one another (consequently)
- making inferences - just like other knowledge but perhaps less confidence
    - backwards - link most recently read text to some text that occurred earlier
    - forward - lets us infer the future (less common)
    - (can be important in expository writing)
- mechanism schema - frame-with-slots is trying to explain the mechanism - biological or human or physical phenomena 
- text level comprehension - as text is read, after certain imbibing certain amounts of text at a time, a reader tries to fit the text into schema 
    - goes slower for text that is a potential slot match
    - two loci for matching in eye fixation studies - first word that indicates a match, last word in sentence
- READER - an AI that does the above processes to emulate humans
    - reader like human is not perfect - imperfect integration into schema, comprehension, or forgetting exact wording at the time of comprehension

- content vs form comprehension - content fits into the structure of the narrative (form)
- semantic content comprehension - understanding the context of say an algebra word problem
- text grammar approach - emphasizes importance of formulat structures and and suggests "distributed decision processes"
- schema approach - emphasizes semantic knowledge, and decisions are made early in comprehension process
    - question whether processing strategy early in the reading matters - 2 strategies
- single processing strategy - no choice at time of reading - i.e. just translate sentences into equations in reading and try to solve after
- function tagging in algebra word problem solving
    - object names - quantities that will be variables in algebraic equations
    - substituitions - quantities that may be replaced by another string 
    - operators - words that signal an operator should be use (times, plus, etc)
- schemas in algebra word problem solving
    - people can organize problems into types
    - people can categorize problems without completely formulating them for solution
    - people have information about how to solve each problem type
    - people use category identification to formulate problems in the course of actually solving them
- algebra word problem categorization - people can categorize algebra word problems with considerable agreement
- categorize can happen two fold - general type then specific type
- subjects have knowledge about problem types but may not know how to use that knowledge for solutions
- standard problems - in which the semantics of the story match the problems structure in an expected way
- tried isomorphic problems but with different algebraic structure - line by line interpret vs read-entire-problem approach
    - line-by-line used more in non-standard problems (general procedure)
    - subjects classified some of the problems while solving them
    - for standard problems, they were solved using info retrieved from memory
- even non-standard problems are solved using schemas - but when the format is drastically different from algebraic structure then there is a translation component into more paraphrased language
- when given options of several schema, bias toward one schema may cause a misapplication of schemas
- choice of schema early on can have an impact sometimes and other times not - they do schema classifications (even when instructions don't tell them to do it explicitly)

schank
- general knowledge - enables a person to understand and interpret another person's actions simply because the other person is a human being with certain standard needs who lives in a world which has certain standard methods of getting those needs fulfilled
- specific knowledge - knowledge about a situation allows us to do less processing and wondering about frequently experienced events 
    - need a high level way of organizing a causal change
    - need a mechanism for recovering steps left out of the causal change
- scripts - common causal chains of events (birthday party -> cake -> candles) that readers can rely on (also frame-and-slots but more specific)
    - are from particular points of view (all pov's together for say a restaurant form the whole view of the restaurant)
    - we can safely assume defaults in the slots (like ordering in the context of restaurant before getting food)
- MAINCONS - main conceptualizations needed to understand the chain of events in the script
- nature of deviations around script - i.e. cold burger means low tip makes sense
- script application - how to apply headers to figure out what script to use in a particular context
- concept - headers are concepts - knowledge we understand related to the script making sense - hunger and restaurant-related knowledge related to the restaurant script 
- precondition header - triggers script based on a precondition or reason
- instrumental header - makes stronger predictions, refers to several contexts where one can be instrumental for the other (subway is instrumental to get to the restaurant)
- locale header - predictive notion of a location where some things happen 
- internal conceptualization header - dependent on role sometimes a script will fit and sometimes it will not (delivery man at restaurant will have a different script than customer)
- interferences - states or actions that prevent the normal continuation of a script 
    - obstacles - an enabling condition is missing
    - errors - action completed with an unexpected or inappropriate result
    - paradigms: Obstacle, Prescription, Success; Error, Loop, Success
    - emotional reactions, abandonment can also happen
- abeyance - temporary disuse or suspension - abandoning the issue temporarily, shifting to another character
- script interactions
    - competing scripts - they compete for words / content (amusing when players think they are in different scripts)
    - scripts being ended with a question - such as buying a watch after eating at a restaurant (did he buy the watch at the restaurant or go somewhere else)
- personal scripts - thought process of the individual or about what an individual is doing in a story, what clinical psychologists are interested in
    - conceal personal script with a different public script (duplicity)
- instrumental scripts - cookbooks, how to turn on a car, etc - rigid scripts that need to be followed in a particular way for something to work (also to distinguish from situational - usually only one actor)
- script based understanding - repetition of situations is assumed
- script acquisition - associating getting a car with getting a key chain just because that script happend once is a process of early learning of scripts by children, we are processing many scripts - this is our training data
